#Rag_based question answer API using FastAPI,LangChain,FAISS & OpenAI

This project builds a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that takes a question in Bengali and returns an answer based on the content of a provided PDF file.

It uses:
- FastAPI to build the web API.
- LangChain for chaining the document retriever and LLM.
- FAISS for vector-based document search.
- OpenAI GPT (via API key) for generating answers.
- PyMuPDF or `fitz` to load PDF.
- Uvicorn as the ASGI server.

# Working Proces 

1. Loads and chunks the PDF document.
2. Converts text chunks into vector embeddings using OpenAI.
3. Stores and searches the vectors using FAISS.
4. Answers user questions based on the most relevant text chunks.
